        <h1><em>Thoughts on Optimism, Pessimism, Trends, and Turning 51</em></h1>

        <br><br>

        <p><strong>Monica’s Note</strong>: James and everyone on the Choose Yourself team are blown away by the feedback we’ve had on his <em>2019 Prediction Summit</em> so far.</p>

        <p>Remember, James goes live on <strong>January 24th at 1 p.m. EST.</strong></p>

        <p>He’s going to reveal how three huge tech trends are on a collision course this year, set to deliver some of the biggest stock market returns we’ve seen since the early 1980s.</p>

        <p>James is so confident that he’s guaranteeing folks who attend will see how to make 10x returns on their money before the end of 2019—enough to turn every $1,000 into $10,000… and every $10,000 into $100,000.</p>

        <p>Since today is James’ 51st birthday, he wanted to share a message about opportunity in 2019… and what it means to be at the cutting edge of trends.</p>

        <p>Check out the bottom of this message for a special note about the event…</p>

        <p>My mom is the most pessimistic person I ever met. My dad was the most optimistic person I ever met.</p>

        <p>My mother had polio when she was two. When she was four years old she had to have a "birthday party" at the hospital where she was alone behind a glass wall and the other kids were on the other side of the wall.</p>

        <p>She walked with a limp for the rest of her life. Kids would ask me at the school bus stop, why does your mom walk so funny? I'd be ashamed and just say I don't know.</p>

        <p>She was a pioneer. In the early 1960s she worked for the very first "independent software company." A software company that wrote programs for any computer.</p>

        <p>Other companies wrote software for just the Univac or the IBM 366 or the whatever else existed then.</p>

        <p>She was the first female programmer in history that wrote software for every type of computer. She is my hero.</p>

        <p>And at that company, she met my father.</p>

        <p>They were private people (unlike me!). I had to read about their meeting in a book, the classic tome: "Your Career in Computer Programming" by IJ Seligsohn.</p>

        <div class="img_container">
          <img src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_10/LF/production/pubs/top/common/img/top_hotlist_012019/programming_book_012019.jpg" alt="Programming Book">
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <p>Seligsohn asked them if they were ever competitive with each other, because they were both programmers. He then was "ready to duck" just in case he hit a "raw nerve."</p>

        <p>"Not at all," S. Altucher said, "We each have different programming strengths. She is more consistent. She can always be counted on to solve a problem more efficiently."</p>

        <p>"And he's a more imaginative programmer," Rita Altucher said, "He's better at designing big decisions."</p>

        <p>IJ Seligsohn's conclusion: "Vive la difference!"</p>


        <p>Perhaps because of her polio, she never thought things were going to work out well.</p>

        <p>When I told her I was going to sell my first company she said, "Maybe just get someone to offer you a job." And when I lost all of my money she never thought I would make it back.</p>

        <p>My dad was the exact opposite. He would have crazy ideas that made no sense and was always sure they were going to make millions.</p>

        <p>When his own software company, which he built up for 20 years, went public, he thought he would be a billionaire. He ended up dead broke and the company went bankrupt.</p>

        <p>He was too optimistic. He bought all his employees cars. Built a new building. Then went broke.</p>

        <p>When we played chess, he'd throw everything at me. Over and over. A massive attack.</p>

        <p>Finally I learned how to defend against him. I started winning every game. "What happened?" he would ask. I'd shrug my shoulders and set up the pieces again.</p>

        <p>Both of them knew computers were the future. Both of them bet their entire careers, their entire lives on it.</p>

        <p>But one was too optimistic and built a failed company. The other was too pessimistic and would take programming jobs well beneath her skills.</p>

        <p>When my dad died, whatever hope my mom had about life was buried with him.</p>


        <p>I grew up seeing the dangers of excess optimism and pessimism.</p>

        <p>Not everything's going to go wrong (mom), but some things will go wrong.</p>

        <p>And I can't ask for a million dollar salary when I'm 23 (dad), but I can always look for new opportunities.</p>

        <p>The economy might be bad now (mom), but there's a thousand ways it could get better (dad).</p>

        <p>Ultimately, I give my dad the edge. There's always opportunities to make money. There are always upward trends that one could take advantage of.</p>

        <p>He quit working in the post office in 1960 when he saw computers were the future. And she decided not to be a math teacher when she figured computers were the future.</p>

        <p>It was hard for me. I took after my dad too much. I was optimistic. I'd make a lot of money. I'd go broke.</p>

        <p>But I became more and more of a realist. Write down ten ideas a day. Read every day. Build your network. Access your network. Find the future trends.</p>

        <p>There's always opportunity. And with each opportunity there are ways to make money. My dad thought he was brilliant at everything. That was his downfall.</p>

        <p>I try to know my weaknesses. To delegate where I'm not strong. To ask questions to people who are smarter than me. To learn learn learn every day. To never rest and say, "all is GOOD!"</p>

        <p>To be careful (mom) and test and look both ways and make sure nothing can get in the way of taking advantage of the opportunities that are now in front of all of us (dad).</p>

        <p>I'm a realist. And I'm practical. Which means I'm ultimately an optimist.</p>

        <p>But not stupid.</p>

        <p>My father is dead. But I am still alive.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Tomorrow morning, we’re going to share what your fellow readers are saying, so you can see how life changing this summit could be for you.</p>

        <p>But before we get to those dream scenarios, let’s focus on a little housekeeping…</p>

        <p>If you’re new to this event and missed any of the earlier content, or if you want to go back and read everything, we’ve created a whole site around this event.</p>

        <p>You can see it here: <a href="https://altucher2019summit.com">https://altucher2019summit.com</a></p>

        <p>Visit as often as you’d like, for free. Inside you’ll find everything we’ve covered so far:</p>

        <p><strong>A Special Welcome Message From James Altucher</strong></p>

        <p><router-link to="/day-1"><strong>Day 1: Introducing Your Millionaire Trend Investor, James Altucher</strong></router-link></p>

        <p><router-link to="/day-2"><strong>Day 2: How My Worst-Selling Book Could Have Made You a Fortune (And Why I’m Doing a Sequel)</strong></router-link></p>

        <p><router-link to="/day-3"><strong>Day 3: It’s Easy to Get Rich With Psychic Powers (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Ride the Trend)</strong></router-link></p>

        <p>To get the most out of Thursday’s FREE event, it’s critical that read all the information above. It’s the only way to really make sure you’re prepared for everything James will reveal.</p>

        <p>One more thing…</p>

        <p>Many of you are wondering if there will be a replay of this free webinar...</p>

        <p>The answer is yes… with a big explanation.</p>

        <p>YES. We are planning on having a “West Coast Replay” on <strong>January 24 at 7 p.m. EST, 4 p.m. PST</strong>. So if you miss what James will have to say the first time, you WILL be able to watch the rebroadcast.</p>

        <p>BUT… For financial reasons, the business can only offer James’ guarantee to the first 1,600 people who respond to the <em>2019 Prediction Summit</em> on Thursday.</p>

        <p>Considering more than 11,400 people have signed up for the event so far (more than 2,000 people per day!)… and considering we’re planning on having 2 to 3 times that amount by the time we go live…</p>

        <p>There’s a very real chance that if you wait to watch this event, you may be locked out of James’ biggest predictions of 2019. Someone else may very well claim your spot to use James’ trend investing strategies for the major moneymaking predictions he thinks could 10x your money.</p>

        <p>We’re not saying that to be pushy. But a fact’s a fact.</p>

        <p>Please do everything you can to attend when we “go live” at 1pm, Eastern.</p>

        <p>If you haven’t signed up for our premiere reminder service already, you can do so here.</p>
