        <h1><em>How My Worst-Selling Book Could Have Made You a Fortune <br class="hidebr">(And Why I’m Doing a Sequel)</em></h1>

        <br><br>

        <p>Nothing good ever comes from giving a stock tip.</p>
        <p>In the worst case, death can result. In the best case, you lose your friends and someone calls you a “scumbag” on the internet.</p>
        <p>Reputation is a byproduct of dignity. Treating people with dignity earns their respect, earns your reputation.</p>
        <p>A prediction is meant to help — based on decades of experience, research, access, connections, and actual skin in the game. I've made a living off of predicting things and then putting money into my beliefs. Research shows the only predictor of a good predictor is... experience!</p>
        <p>Then you predict to give back. To help others. And because you participate in the ongoing conversation about what the future has in store for all of us you get even more knowledge. I owe my reputation as a futurist, as a successful investor, as an entrepreneur and as a successful writer to these predictions.</p>
        <p>The only way I get to keep getting these benefits is if my reputation as a futurist remains intact. How do I do that? If I'm right.</p>
        <p>If I invest accordingly so I can make the money that secures my freedom and the freedom of my readers. And if I do the hard work.</p>

        <p>But “bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones.” That’s what the psychologist Roy F. Baumeister said in the article “Bad Is Stronger Than Good.”</p>
        <p>People need to experience 5 to 6 positives to outweigh every 1 negative.</p>
        <p>When it comes to stock or crypto predictions, it’s more like infinity-plus-one positives for every negative. I’ve gotten things RIGHT and still received death threats. It’s impossible.</p>
        <p>And yet people still approach me on the street or in my comedy club asking for tips. I’ve been writing hundreds of articles about investing every year for more than a decade. I’ve probably written close to 5000 articles about stocks. I’ve written like 6 books (or is it 7 now?) on investing, for god’s sake.</p>
        <p>I’m even going live this Thursday — January 24th at 1 p.m. — to hold a 2019 predictions summit, where I’ll be revealing some of my most controversial predictions ever.</p>
        <p><strong>On top of that, I’m guaranteeing anyone who attends and follows my research will see how to make 10 times their money in 2019.</strong></p>
        <h3>So why the heck am I doing this?</h3>
        <p>The answer is simple…</p>
        <p>The most powerful moneymaking trends we’ve ever seen will come to a head in 2019.</p>
        <p>More than that, this year will completely change the economic landscape of America. People need to prepare themselves and their families… and position themselves to profit.</p>
        <p>Most people wait too long to invest in new trends. Mostly because of doubt. Or fear.</p>
        <p>They end up missing out.</p>
        <p>But on <strong>January 24th, at 1 p.m. EST</strong>, I’m going to show you a simple strategy that will help you get ahead of these trends…</p>
        <p>It’s the same strategy I used to make $2.4 million cash with a small side business I built and sold. The same one I used to make 6,000%, 3,600%, and 7,100% as an investor.</p>
        <p>And the same one I wrote about in my book <em>The Forever Portfolio</em>.</p>
        <div class="right_img_container">
          <img class="right" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/production/pubs/top/common/img/top_hotlist_012019/TOP_2019PREDICTIONSEVENT_FOREVERPORTFOLIOBOOK_012019.png" alt="James's The Forever Portfolio book">
          <p>I’m proud of that book. It has a crossword puzzle in it. Investing ideas, too. It came out 10 years ago, in November of 2008. The middle of the worst financial crisis in 80 years.</p>
          <p>It flopped hard.</p>
          <p>Turns out, nobody want to hear about buying stocks when the world is ending. </p>
          <p>But the world didn’t end. It never does, whenever the media spouts doom and gloom.</p>
        </div>
        <p>And in the book I predicted some major trends would translate into big dollars with the right investments. I even laid out the EXACT stocks for capitalizing on those trends.</p>
        <p>Not only did it flop, the few people who did read it only gave it 3 stars on Amazon.</p>
        <p>One reviewer said it was “horribly written”...</p>
        <p>Another said it was “superficial” and “not very useful”...</p>
        <p>And one guy even said it was “worthless” and called me a scam artist.</p>
        <p>So it goes. Like I said, nothing good ever comes from giving stock tips…</p>
        <h3>But My Predictions Could Have Landed You a Fortune</h3>
        <p>After it came out, I went around to every bookstore in the city. I would write notes on the inside of every copy and then put them back on the bookshelf.</p>
        <p>Things like, “If you buy this book you will make a billion dollars.”</p>
        <p>Or, “You are the smartest person in the world for buying this book.”</p>
        <p>Who knows. Maybe the book did make someone a billionaire. It could have! 300 or so people bought it.</p>
        <p>And the stocks I recommended in it went up huge over the next few years.</p>
        <p>Gains from My 2008 Book, <em>The Forever Portfolio</em></p>
        <div class="img_container">
          <img class="w100" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_22/LF/production/pubs/top/common/img/top_hotlist_012019/TOP_2019PREDICTIONSEVENT_CHART01_012019.png" alt="Gains from The Forever Portfolio book">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <p>One stock I mentioned on page 206, Tucows (TCX), returned 6,025%. Enough to turn $1,000 bucks into $61,250.</p>
        <p>Just to put all those numbers in perspective…</p>
        <p>If you’d simply bought the stocks you see above, you’d have outperformed the overall market by 338% during the longest bull run in history.</p>
        <div class="img_container">
          <img class="w100" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/production/pubs/top/common/img/top_hotlist_012019/TOP_2019PREDICTIONSEVENT_CHART04_012019.png" alt="S&P 500 vs. The Forever Portfolio">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <p>That’s enough to turn the average retirement account into nearly $937,276.</p>
        <p>To put it another way: If you had bought, read, and acted on the predictions in my “horribly written,” “not very useful” book back then…</p>
        <p>You could have set yourself up for life. Easy early retirement.</p>
        <p>Now, I’m not saying to buy that book. (Please don’t buy that book.)</p>
        <p>And there are two reasons for that:</p>
        <p><strong>A)</strong> The stocks in the book are up huge, but now it’s out of date. I mean, I know the book says “Forever” but nothing is forever. Many of the trends I talked about 10 years ago have played out. New stuff is happening!</p>
        <p><strong>B)</strong> So what? Who cares what I said 10 years ago?</p>
        <p>So I made predictions that could have made you a millionaire several times over. Big whoop.</p>
        <p>“What have you done lately? What will make me a millionaire now?” I hear you cry.</p>
        <h3>What I’m Going to Do For You Now</h3>
        <p>In the 10 years since I wrote <em>The Forever Portfolio</em>, I’ve been following a handful of new trends. I did a ton of research and now I’m certain of how they’re going to impact people… the economy… and the stock market.</p>
        <p>And I don’t want these predictions to go to waste again.</p>
        <p><strong>That’s why I’m sharing my most powerful moneymaking predictions with you on January 24th at 1 p.m. Eastern… during my 2019 Prediction Summit — <em>totally for FREE</em>.</strong></p>
        <p>During this live, “invite only” event, I’ll tell you…</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>My Top Three Predictions That Could Make You a 10X Your Money in 2019</strong>… Including the specific investments on my radar <em>right now</em> that could stand to reap the biggest gains as these trends unfold.</li>
          <li><strong>Why We are NOT Going to See Another Recession — No Matter What the Financial Media Says</strong>... You’re probably hearing naysayers in the news claiming we’re about to see a market crash... I’ll prove that they’re 100% wrong, and why we’re actually about to witness the biggest UP year we’ve seen in decades.</li>
          <li><strong>How a Rare “Super-Convergence” of Trends Could Send a Small Handful of Stocks on a 1,000% Tear, Starting Just Weeks from Now</strong>… The last time we saw an event like this, investors had the chance to capture gains of 144,400% on a single company over the span of four decades. This time, I’m predicting it will start in the next <em>12 months</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I think value I’m giving in the event is worth at least $525… and certainly the hour or so it will take to watch.</p>
        <p><strong>But I’m putting this on, for FREE, because I want to give YOU the chance to get in on these predictions and make a fortune.</strong></p>
        <p>When they take off, they’re going to blow my <em>Forever Portfolio</em> gains out of the water.</p>
        <p>Remember 2000 when everyone said, “Man, I wish I knew a boom was coming in 1996”? Well, here we are again.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind, you will NOT find this information anywhere else after this event.</p>
        <p>I’m not writing another book about it. I’m not going over it on my podcast or website.</p>
