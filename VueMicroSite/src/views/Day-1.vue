        <h1><em>Introducing Your Millionaire Trend Investor, James Altucher</em></h1>

        <br><br>

        <p>Hi, my name is Monica McCarthy, and I’ll be hosting the <strong><em>2019 Prediction Summit</em></strong> with best-selling author and millionaire trend investor, James Altucher.</p>
        <p>
          Remember, we go live with James’ breakthrough moneymaking predictions on <strong>January 24th at 1PM, Eastern</strong>…
        </p>
        <p>
          And James has prepared an outrageous guarantee for you…
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong><em>*** Put simply, during the event James is willing to guarantee that you will see how to make 10x returns on your money before the end of 2019. ***</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s 1,000% -- an extreme promise. Perhaps the most extreme promise in our business.
        </p>

        <p>
          But James is making that promise with confidence. And if you’ve known James for years like I have, this would come as no surprise.
        </p>

        <div class="img_container">
          <img src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/production/pubs/top/common/img/top_hotlist_012019/TOP_2019DAY1JAMES_012019.png" alt="James and Mellisa">
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <p>
          So before we dive into that guarantee and the 2019 predictions giving him so much confidence, let me tell you a little more about my friend James...
        </p>

        <p>
          Because it’s his unique, quirky, unconventional background that could lead to you potentially making a fortune in the next few months.
        </p>

        <p>
          What do I mean? Well, just take a look at this <em>Forbes.com</em> article…
        </p>

        <p>
          In it they call James “The Most Interesting Man In The World” (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianrashid/2016/09/06/james-altucher-the-most-interesting-man-in-the-world/#c3360e766d00" target="_blank">Go ahead, read Forbes’ article for yourself right here</a>.)
        </p>

        <p>
          The author of the article writes…
        </p>

        <div class="pre">
          <p>“This man has changed my life, and the lives of thousands of people that follow his every word. He is the most valuable mentor I have…”</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          And because James has changed so many lives, he is now a very wealthy man. But he wasn’t always a millionaire…
        </p>

        <p>
          Early in life he made at least $15 million by building and selling his own company.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then he nearly lost it all…
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m sure he’ll tell you all about it during the summit on January 24th… how he was so depressed… how he hit rock bottom.
        </p>

        <p>
          He actually thought about taking his own life so his kids could get his life insurance payout.
        </p>

        <p>
          Heart-wrenching, but true.
        </p>

        <p>
          He found a way to come out on top. But again, disaster struck…
        </p>

        <h3>
          The Magic Power of James’ 1,000% Crystal Ball
        </h3>

          Here’s What Your Fellow Readers Are Saying They’d Do With an Extra $100,000 by 2020

        <p>
          Here’s what your fellow readers are saying they’d do with an extra $100,000…
        </p>

        <!-- quotes -->
        <div class="pre"><strong>“I need a steady stream of income for retirement,”</strong>
        <br><br><span class="text_light">-- Reader from St. Louis, MO</span></div>
        <div class="pre"><strong>“[I’d use the money] for a base for an investment pool that I can continue to grow”</strong>
        <br><br><span class="text_light">-- Reader from Northport, NY</span></div>
        <div class="pre"><strong>“Start a hospitality business, invest in real estate and quit my job”</strong>
        <br><br><span class="text_light">-- Reader from Nairobi</span></div>
        <div class="pre"><strong>“I’d pay off my credit card debt and my car. With the leftover money? I’d max out my IRA”</strong>
        <br><br><span class="text_light">-- Reader from NY</span></div>

        <p>
          Later James found himself going through a divorce… raising a young daughter… and he needed more money to get by.
        </p>

        <p>
          He had about $2,000 to his name – and was looking for a way to basically just multiply that money as quickly and safely as possible.
        </p>

        <p><strong>*** That’s when he discovered a simple formula for predicting the future...</strong></p>

        <p>
          It essentially gives James a “crystal ball,” allowing him to predict which breakthrough innovations and trends promised the greatest profit potential.
        </p>

        <p>
          He tested it by starting a business from his home computer… and walked away with a $2.4 million profit in seven months.
        </p>

        <p>
        	But that wasn’t enough. He took his profits and began investing…
        </p>

        <p>
          And the results were astonishing:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
          6,000% on the social media company Buddy Media
          </li>
          <li>
          3,600% on the media company Ticketfly
          </li>
          <li>
          7,100% on the cryptocurrency zCash
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>And just like that, James literally became a multimillionaire once again.</p>

        <p>If it’s one thing I know about James, though… It’s not enough for him to get rich alone.</p>

        <p>He’s not happy unless he’s helping other people achieve more fulfillment, security, and wealth.</p>

        <p>So he started using his “crystal ball” powers to share his predictions with the world. </p>

        <p>For example, he went on CNBC back in 2007 to tell people that Facebook would be a $100 billion company.</p>

        <p>They laughed in his face. </p>

        <p>But they weren’t laughing when they called him back in 2012 to apologize and admit he was right!</p>

        <p>You can see that on camera here:</p>

        <div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper">
          <div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_zfeu85ylia videoFoam=true playbar=true fullscreenButton=true  playButton=false autoPlay=false">&nbsp;</div>
        </div>

        <p>James didn’t stop there. </p>

        <p>In 2008, during the financial crisis, he turned his crystal ball to the trends he saw shaping the stock market. He wrote a book called <em>The Forever Portfolio</em> predicting which stocks would take off due to these trends. </p>

        <p>Those predictions did <em>phenomenally</em> well. </p>

        <p>In fact, they outperformed the market up to 4 times over. </p>

        <p>(James actually has a funny story about that… keep your eye on your inbox tomorrow for a special Altucher Confidential and he’ll tell you about it!)</p>

        <h3>So why am I sharing all this with you?</h3>

        <p>Because on <strong>January 24th</strong>, James plans to reveal his three biggest predictions for 2019… and show you how to profit from them, too.</p>

        <p>But James’ story doesn’t stop there… </p>

        <p>You see, he’s reinvented himself time and time again… </p>

        <p>And every time he did, he tried to make all the strategies and opportunities available to people who put their faith in him.</p>

        <p>For example, he ran his own $33 million hedge fund, managing his and other people’s capital. His returns were so good, he was able to start his own fund. </p>

        <p>As far as I know, he’s become the most successful self-published author in history -- selling more than 1,000,000 copies of his 18 different books… </p>

        <p>Including one book that USA Today calls “one of the 12 best business books of all time…”</p>

        <p>He’s started and run more than 20 companies... and sold several of those businesses for large exits. </p>

        <p>He sat on the boards of several companies. </p>

        <p>His writing has appeared in almost all the major national media outlets … including the Wall Street Journal, ABC, Financial Times, TechCrunch, Forbes, CNBC and on and on… </p>

        <p>His blog has attracted more than 30 million readers since its launch in 2010. </p>

        <p>And his podcast on Apple iTunes has more than 34 million downloads, with guests like Shark Tank's Daymond John & Mark Cuban... businesswoman and author Tyra Banks… Tim Robbins… Maria Konnikova... and even Kareem Abdul Jabbar.  </p>

        <p>In fact, here are a few of the podcasts he did with some of the richest, smartest, most successful people on the planet!</p>
